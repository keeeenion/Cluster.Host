# Cluster.Host
> A new server hosting service with a twist.

## About the project

Grab a copy of the [LICENSE right here!](LICENSE).

The plan is to develop a new open source* server hosting service. For now It's a private project I'll be tinkering on. As a full stack dev I'm responsible for every aspect. I won't be sharing the innovative idea behind the whole project just yet. Anyways the project itself is divided into multiple subprojects...

*Most of the materials are open sourced.

here's the list:

| Subprojects | Ideas behind 'em | Repository links |
| --- | --- | :---: |
| Wiki | It's the main repository | [Cluster.Host](https://github.com/keeeenion/Cluster.Host) |
| Website | Cluster.Host's landing page design | [Cluster.Host-Website](https://github.com/keeeenion/Cluster.Host-Webpage) |
| Admin Dashboard | Admin dashboard for users to manage their services | [Cluster.Host-Admin-Dashboard](https://github.com/keeeenion/Cluster.Host-Admin-Dashboard) |
| Server ingredients | All the shenanigans regarding servers setup, work and security | [Cluster.Host-Servers](https://github.com/keeeenion/Cluster.Host-Servers) |
| Dockerfiles | Dockerfiles for building systems running hosted services | [Cluster.Host-Dockerfiles](https://github.com/keeeenion/Cluster.Host-Dockerfiles) |
